# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction
Created out of a desire to learn and experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this Tic Tac Toe game features a challenging AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning.

## Features
- **Single Player Mode**: Compete against a sophisticated AI designed to make optimal moves.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive, making it playable on a variety of devices, from phones to desktop computers.

## How to Play
Access the game directly through [this link](https://justharsh.xyz/game.html). The game consists of a 3x3 grid where you play as X and the AI plays as O. The goal is to align three of your symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the AI does. If all squares are filled without either player aligning three symbols, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Forms the structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the game to be visually appealing and functional across different devices.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game mechanics and the AI using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

## Future Plans
- **Theme Customization**: Implement the ability to change themes for the game board and player symbols.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Plan to develop a version where two players can compete against each other remotely.

## Conclusion
This project not only helped in understanding the fundamentals of web development but also in applying complex algorithms in practical applications. I'm excited to continue developing this game and adding more features based on player feedback.
